docker run "container_name"             creates and runs a container,
                                        shows the logs of the container

docker ps                               shows all running docker containers
docker ps -all                          show all docker containers you ever ran

docker create "container_name"          creates the container
docker start -a "id"                    starts the container, runs what it contains

docker system prune                     deletes all containers and build cache
docker logs "id"                        shows the logs for the container

docker stop "id"                        gives the container time to shut down
docker kill "id"                        stops the container with no cleanup

docker exec -it "id" "command"          insert a new command into the container
                                        example: docker exec -it d07b45287854 redis-cli
                                        -it = -i an -t , -i = direct message to stdin channel
                                        -t = prettifies the output

docker exec -it "id" sh                 opens the docker container with shell
                                        sh = another command shell / terminal
